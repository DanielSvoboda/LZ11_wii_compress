This is a modified version of dsdecmp that allows for the:<br>
__Compression__ of files into the Wii LZ77 type 11 format '.lz'<br>
It was designed to be easy to use for compressing Wii mod files.<br>
This code was also implemented in this project: [Switch-Toolbox](https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox)
<br><br>
The program has been tested with:<br>
__Paper Mario: Color Splash for the Wii U.__<br>
The game files were decompressed and modified,<br>
and then using this program to do compression again.<br>

I don't know which other Wii games use this compress to<br>
do tests, maybe the way the header is mounted is different.<br>
If you know of any, mention them in 'Issues'
